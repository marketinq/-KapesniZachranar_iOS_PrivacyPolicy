Privacy policy for app Kapesní záchranář


**Privacy Policy**

Thomas Melichar built the Kapesní záchranář app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Thomas Melichar at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. But the app does not collect any data at all (there is not analytics code, no tracing).

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Kapesní záchranář unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2023-07-07
